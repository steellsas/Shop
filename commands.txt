Launching asynchronous tasks with
Celery
Everything you execute in a view affects response times. In many situations,
you might want to return a response to the user as quickly as possible and let the
server execute some process asynchronously. This is especially relevant for timeconsuming
processes or processes subject to failure, which might need a retry
policy. For example, a video sharing platform allows users to upload videos but
requires a long time to transcode uploaded videos. The site might return a response
to users to inform them that the transcoding will start soon, and start transcoding
the video asynchronously. Another example is sending emails to users. If your site
sends email notifications from a view, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
connection might fail or slow down the response. Launching asynchronous tasks
is essential to avoid blocking the code execution.
Celery is a distributed task queue that can process vast amounts of messages. Using
Celery, not only can you create asynchronous tasks easily and let them be executed
by workers as soon as possible, but you can also schedule them to run at a specific
time.
You can find the Celery documentation at http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/
latest/index.html.
